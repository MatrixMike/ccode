An idea to have an introduction to programming workshop - very basic - using geany (pronounced genie as in the magic lantern)

What I do with Linux ( investigating config files - making different systems talk to each other - 
Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Manjaro and others - package managers are different 


Tie it in with github

bring laptops
install geany
